# Program Overview

This Python program helps you keep track of your daily progress by recording the number of lines written in your code files, your daily reflections, and the material covered. It creates an entry in a journal file (`journal.txt`) with the information provided.

## Instructions

2. **How are you feeling today:**
   - Share your feelings or thoughts about your day.

3. **Number of programs written today:**
   - Input the number of programs you have written or edited during your session.

4. **File Name (for each program):**
   - Provide the name of each file you've worked on to calculate the total lines written.

## Functionality

1. The program reads the number of lines from each file and calculates the total number of lines written.
2. It prompts you to input the material covered and your daily reflections.
3. It appends your input along with the current date to the `journal.txt` file.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to input the required information.
3. Your entry will be saved to `journal.txt`.

## Files

1. `lineswritten.txt`: Contains the total number of lines written in the code files.
2. `journal.txt`: Journal file where your daily entries are stored.

## Date Stamp

The program automatically records the current date for each entry.

## Note

Ensure that you input the correct file names and paths when prompted.

Feel free to customize the program to suit your specific needs or preferences.
